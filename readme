# Spam-Ham Classifier (NLP Project)

This project is a **Spam vs. Ham** message classifier using Natural Language Processing techniques. It uses a dataset of text messages to train a model that can distinguish between spam (unwanted) and ham (legitimate) messages.

## 📁 Files

- `NLP.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook containing all code for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## 🧠 Features

- Text cleaning and preprocessing (stopwords, punctuation, stemming, etc.)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Model training (e.g., Naive Bayes or others)
- Accuracy and performance metrics
- Word cloud visualization
- Confusion matrix

## 🚀 Getting Started
